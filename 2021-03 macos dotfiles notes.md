### Random Notes

#### **.bashrc vs .bash_profile** 
- The ```rc``` files are for all shell invocations while the ```profiles``` are strictly for interactive shells.
- An *interactive* shell is where you (end user) types the command while a *non-interactive shell* is when shells are launched by other programs such as a script with #!/bin/bash 
- By default ```~/.bashrc``` is executed as part of ```~/.bash_profile``` to load the alias function
- so, when you login via SSH, or via duplicate console, or via switch user: ```.bash_profile``` is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt. But, if youâ€™ve already logged into your machine and open a new terminal window (xterm) or just start a new bash instance just by typing ```/bin/bash``` in a terminal then .bashrc is executed before the window command prompt.

#### Which file (.bashrc or .bash_profile) should we modify

- As a general rule, to add directories to your ```PATH``` or define additional environment variables, place those changes in ```.bash_profile``` (or the equivalent, according to your distribution; for example, Ubuntu uses ```.profile```).
- For everything else, place the changes in ```.bashrc```.
